With the map in hand, you make your way deeper into the library, past rows of towering bookshelves and ancient tomes. You finally reach a door, hidden behind a tapestry. The emerald symbol on the map matches the carving on the door.

You push it open and step into a chamber filled with treasures: artifacts, jewels, and scrolls. But at the center stands a mirror, covered in a layer of frost. An inscription above it reads:

> "Face your true self, or be forever bound."

What will you do?
