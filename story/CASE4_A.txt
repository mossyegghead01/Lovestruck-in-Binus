"Umm... I don't think so," you reply, glancing at him curiously. Michael's smile widens, and he leans in slightly.

"Great. How about we grab a bite together? My treat."

"Sure," you say, feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. The idea of spending more time with him sounds better than anything else.

Michael leads the way as you both walk to a nearby café just outside the campus. The place is cozy, filled with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the soft hum of chatter. He picks a table by the window and gestures for you to sit.

"So, Shannon," he says, resting his chin on his hand, "tell me more about yourself. What do you like to do in your free time?"

You think for a moment before answering, "I'm into photography. I love capturing moments and telling stories through pictures. What about you?"

Michael's eyes light up. "That's amazing. I'm into music. I play the guitar and write songs sometimes. Maybe we could collaborate—photos and music go hand in hand."

You laugh softly. "That sounds like a great idea. I'd love to see your work someday."

"Deal," he says, smiling warmly. The conversation flows effortlessly as you both share stories, laughter, and dreams. By the time you finish your drinks, it feels like you've known each other for years.

As you step outside, Michael looks at you with a soft expression. "I'm really glad we did this," he says. "It's been a while since I've enjoyed someone's company this much."

"Me too," you admit, feeling a warmth in your chest. It's clear that this is the start of something special.
