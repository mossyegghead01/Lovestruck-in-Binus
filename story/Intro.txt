The air is thick with the scent of aged parchment and faint whispers of a long-lost magic.

You stand in the dimly lit library, the only sound being the quiet crackle of a dying fire in the corner. Dust motes dance in the pale light filtering through a high, stained-glass window.

The codex, bound in cracked leather and stamped with an ancient sigil, sits alone on a pedestal. You can feel a #Rfaint pulse#r of energy emanating from it, as if it's alive... waiting.

What will you do?
