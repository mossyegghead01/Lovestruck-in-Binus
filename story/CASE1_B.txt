So, I walked away with the hope that he doesn't follow me around. But while I was looking back to make sure he doesn't follow, I suddenly bumped someone with a cyan shirt. Reflectively, he held me by the shoulders to make sure I didn't fall. 

"you okay?"

--> I'm okay *while looking down and flustered
--> I'm okay *while looking straight at him and smiling
