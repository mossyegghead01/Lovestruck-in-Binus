"I'm actually looking for my group and my freshmen leader but I can't seem to find them, can you help me find them?" I said. Then he replied, "which class are you in? I'll help you find them!" With gratitude I said, "Thank you so much! I'm looking for BG75,"

"Oh I actually know where they are! C'mon follow me," he replied.

Then we started walking side by side while walking towards my class.

After a bit of silence, I finally manage to say, "Thank you for walking me to my class! What's your name by the way?"

"My name's Joseph, what's yours?" he replied.

"My name's Shannon," I replied.

"I see, that name suits you well, what a beautiful name!" He said with a smile.

I looked at him with surprise, then replied, "thanks, I know,"

He chuckled then said, "Here we are, would you like to sit together?"

"Sure," I said with a big smile.
