As I walked down the atrium, I saw him approach me from the stairs. My face lit up and I ran and approached him too.

Then suddenly his face got nervous and he suddenly just blurted out, "Hey you're a wonderful person and I feel like I fell for you,"

I stopped dead in my tracks and just looked at him with surprise.

"It's alright if you don't feel the same way, but I just wanted to speak my mind, I don't mind if we continued being friends," he continued.

Then with some courage, I managed to reply, "um, I actually also like you Joseph, since the first time we sat together,"

His face lit up like a Christmas tree and he said, "THEN LET'S GO OUT!"

I smiled brightly then said, "Let's go!"
