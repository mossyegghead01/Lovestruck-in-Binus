As I walked down the atrium, I saw him sitting by himself on the stairs. Then I mustered up my courage and approached him, "Hey," I said

"Hey what's up?" He replied

"Nothing much, I just wanted to say thank you for getting me through OTP, you've been a wonderful Freshmen Leader, and I just wanted to ask you, would you like to go and get coffee some time?" I managed to say with a fumble

He looked at me with surprise, then with a sorry look on his face, "Hey just to clear things up, you're a wonderful person, but I see you as a good friend and a little sister, maybe we should keep a distance after this so I don't hurt your feelings deeper," he said with a sad face.

I just looked down and blushed.
