Today is the first day of fyp, you are shannon, a freshmen who feels lost, lonely, and nervous in the middle of these crowd of strangers. Suddenly, you hear a footstep approach you. He asked you if you're lost and you said yes.

Then he said "c'mon, would you like to seat with me?"

--> Sure! (case 1a)
--> No thanks, I'm waiting for a friend (case 1b)
